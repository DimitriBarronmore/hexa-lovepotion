## Non-Functional 3DS Port

This is an experiment in frustration and lovepotion having a number of weirdly missing features. I've been unable to get this to work thus far, and I suspect that getting the game to run well on lovepotion on the 3DS could require a more complete rewrite.

## OG Readme

My first ever game for personal computers â€” an enhanced port of the [Playdate original](https://play.date/games/hexa)! I can't guarantee any good-practice code in here, but feel free to poke around and see if there's anything that may prove useful to you.

A full list of credits and dependencies can be found [here](https://rae.wtf/blog/hexa-manual#credits).

If you wanna play this game, it's available for purchase [here](https://raewtf.itch.io/hexa). Or, if you just LOVE command line tools and HATE paying money for things, compress the contents, use `love` to run the program, and enjoy!
